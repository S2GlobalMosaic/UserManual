    Mosaic
        A mosaic is composed of multiple input data.

    Medoid
        A medoid is representative object of a data set or a cluster with a data set whose average dissimilarity to all the
        objects in the cluster is minimal. A medoid is similar in concept to mean or centroid, but medoid is always
        restricted to be members of the data set.

    STC
        :ref:`Short Term Composite <stc>` methodology. A compositing methodology inspired by the WELD algorithm. It is used for shorter periods with less input data.

    WELD
        Web Enabled Landsat Data. The WELD project generates global composited and mosaicked True color Landsat 7 Enhanced
        Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30 meter resolution imagery in monthly and annual time increments. Details on the algorithm
        can be found `here`__.
