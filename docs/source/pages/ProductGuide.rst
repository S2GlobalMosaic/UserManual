The content of Mosaic Hub products is variable and depends on the selection done by the user during the :ref:`order process <order>`.
The Product Guide describes all available contents.

.. _data:

Data
****
All Mosaic Hub products provide 22 raster bands selectable by the user
during the order process (see section :ref:`Order Panel <orderPanel>`). Available
raster bands comprise:

- 11 surface reflectance bands
- 4 quality indicator bands
- 4 sun/view geometry bands
- 2 validation bands
- 1 quality band

The following chapter give more detailed information on the available bands.

.. _surface_reflectance_bands:

Surface reflectance bands
=========================
The Mosaic Hub delivers products with surface reflectance bands chosen by the user in
the :ref:`band selection <orderPanel>` section of the Mosaic Hub order panel.
The surface reflectance is computed using the “Sentinel-2 Atmospheric Correction”
(L2A_AtmCorr) algorithm implemented into Sen2Cor and is based on Radiative Transfer Look-Up Tables (LUTs) pre-calculated with LibRadtran.

.. .. todo::
   Shouldn't we refer to Sen2Cor here instead of L2A_AtmCorr? Sen2Cor is referenced at other location in the user manual, too.

The following :ref:`table <surface_reflectance_bands_table>` lists the available bands and corresponding native
resolutions of the Sentinel-2 L2A input products.

Resolution
**********
All raster products of the Mosaic Hub are provided in uniform resolution and are available in three different resolutions:

- 10m
- 20m
- 60m

.. _crs:

Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
**********************************
The raster products of the Mosaic Hub are provided either projected in UTM(WGS84) or unprojected (lat/lon) using WGS84.

.. _utm:

UTM
===
The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) conformal projection is not a single map projection. Instead, the system divides the Earth into sixty zones, each being a six-degree band of longitude,
and uses a secant transverse Mercator projection in each zone. WGS84 is used as ellipsoid for UTM.

.. _wgs:

WGS84
=====
WGS84 is an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed terrestrial reference system and geodetic datum.
WGS84 is based on a consistent set of constants and model parameters that describe
the Earth's size, shape, and gravity and geomagnetic fields.

File Formats
************
The Mosaic Hub raster products are available in three different file formats:

- GeoTiff
- Jpeg2000
- NetCDF

The properties of the file formats are described in the following chapter. Where needed, a
distinction is made between the different formats.

File Structure
==============
File structures are mainly identical for GeoTiff,
Jpeg2000, and NetCDF. Therefore, no explizit chapters for the single formats
exist. Differences are indicated within the individual sections.

.. _folders:

Folders
-------
The Mosaic Hub products are organized in a folder structure. The product's structure
consists of a base folder, containing all data of one order, a sub/tile folder
containing one or multiple folders, holding a single product or tiles if a tiling is needed.
Within these sub folders, the actual data is stored.

Example of the folder and file structure for the GeoTiff format:


.. _fileStructExample:
.. figure:: images/FileStructure.png
   :name: FileStructureExample
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: File structure example
   :align: center

   Example of the file/folder structure

.. _files:

Files
-----
Depending on the format, the number of files varies.

GeoTiff/Jpeg2000:
    The product is delivered in 23 separate files. 22 GeoTiff/Jpeg2000 files
    contain the raster bands described in the :ref:`'Data' <data>` section, one JSON file containing metadata
    information, and one XML file also containing INSPIRE conform metadata information.

NetCDF:
    The product is delivered in 2 separate files. One NetCDF file containing all raster bands, one JSON file containing
    metadata information, and one XML file also containing INSPIRE conform metadata information.

.. _tiling:

Tiling
------
The product is split into the area of original Sentinel-2 granules.
For a detailed description of the Sentinel-2 tiling scheme please
visit the `official website`__. A tiling of the products is only done
if the :ref:`UTM <utm>` projection is chosen as :ref:`CRS <crs>` and the
chosen area exceeds a certain size.

.. _naming_conventions:

Naming conventions
==================
Naming conventions are mainly identical for GeoTiff,
Jpeg2000, and NetCDF. Therefore, no explicit chapters for the individual formats
exist (differences are indicated where necessary).

The product name (folders & files) contains key information on its content. Product names
support easy identification of relevant files and support meaningful sorting.
The Mosaic Hub product names are constructed according to the following naming convention:

Base folder
-----------

S2GM_{TemporalIdentifierSpatialIdentifier}_{PeriodStart}_{PeriodEnd}_{OrderName}_[ConfIndicator] _v{Version}_[{uniqueID}].{FileExtension}

In short, and with the correct length indicated by placeholders:

S2GM_{TSS}_{SSSSSSSS}_{EEEEEEEE}_{AA...AA}_[CCC]_v{X.Y.Z}_[DDD}.{ext}

Two examples:
    S2GM_Q10_20171001_20171230_MyPersonalRequest_STD__v1.0.0_385.tiff
    S2GM_M60_20170401_20170430_SPAIN_STD__v1.0.0_420.netCDF

.. _base_folder_table:

.. csv-table:: Base folder naming convention
   :file: csv/base_folder_naming_convention.csv
   :delim: ;
   :widths: 10, 60, 30
   :header-rows: 1

|


Subfolders
----------

The naming of the subfolders differ for tiled and none-tiled products (see :ref:`tiling <tiling>`).

*Non-tiled products*: The subfolder name is equal to the order name (see {AA...AA} in :ref:`base folder table <base_folder_table>`)

*Tiled products*: The subfolder names are equal to Sentinel-2 granule names (see :ref:`tiling <tiling>`)

Files
-----
The file naming differs for GeoTiff/Jpeg2000 and NetCDF due to the structuring of the files.

**GeoTiff/Jpeg2000:**

For the GeoTiff and Jpeg2000 format, all raster bands are stored as separate files (see :ref:`Files <files>`)

{RasterBandIdentifier}_{TemporalIdentifierSpatialIdentifier}_{PeriodStart}_{OrderName}.{FileExtension}

In short, and with the correct length indicated by placeholders (if not variable; variability indicated by ...):

{BB...BB}_{TSS}_{SSSSSSSS}_{AA...AA}.{ext}

*Example: B04_M60_20170701_Northern_Germany.jp2*

.. _file_naming_tif_jpg_table:

.. csv-table:: File naming convention GeoTiff/Jpeg200
   :file: csv/file_naming_convention_tif_jpg.csv
   :delim: ;
   :widths: 9, 32, 59
   :header-rows: 1

|

**NetCDF**

For the NetCDF format, all raster bands are stored in a single NetCDF (.nc) file (see :ref:`Files <files>`)

{TemporalIdentifierSpatialIdentifier}_{PeriodStart}_{OrderName}.{FileExtension}

In short, and with the correct length indicated by placeholders (if not variable; variability indicated by ...):

{TSS}_{SSSSSSSS}_{AA...AA}.{ext}

*Example:*
    *M60_20170701_Northern_Germany.nc*

    *metadata_20170701_Northern_Germany.json*

   :file: csv/file_naming_convention_netcdf.csv
   :delim: ;
   :widths: 9, 32, 59
   :header-rows: 1

The metadata file is prefixed with 'metadata/_'

Metadata
========

The intention of the metadata provided with the Sentinel-2 mosaics is to deliver transparent information about the
production process and useful technical details facilitating the further use of the data. Each mosaic contains
metadata in terms of an XML (INSPIRE-compliant) and JSON (containing additional relevant metadata) file. In addition,
data which has been ordered in the NetCDF format will have metadata included internally. The metadata can be grouped
into the following categories:

- General metadata which contain quasi static information, such as the name of the service, contact information, etc.
  These are primarily emerging from INSPIRE requirements and are reported in an INSPIRE-compliant XML file.
- Production metadata provide detailed information how the product has been produced including production date and time,
  algorithm version, information of data lineage, and the list of Sentinel-2 input products linked with the source
  index file (included in the JSON file).
- Quality indicators at product level are stored in the quality metadata group (included in the JSON file).
- In addition, variable metadata provide information on specific variables. Several items of them reveal technical
  details (scaling and offset parameters, units, etc.) on the way the data is organised in the file, which can then be
  interpreted by the software reading the data. (included in the JSON file).

The GeoTiff / Jpeg2000 files contain the INSPIRE-compliant XML and a JSON file, while the NetCDF additionally includes
the same information in the internal metadata.

Software
********

In this section, you will get a brief introduction how to open Mosaic Hub products in SNAP or QGIS. The introduction is
limited to the two most common open source platforms used for Sentinel-2 data.

.. _snap:

SNAP
====
`SNAP`__ stands for Sentinel Aplication Platform and is the official ESA software and common architecture for all
Sentinel Toolboxes. It can be downloaded at: http://step.esa.int/main/download/

.. _SnapWeb: http://step.esa.int/

__ SnapWeb_

The simplest way of directly using the Mosaic Hub products is by using SNAP.
In SNAP you can simply select the .json file in the open file dialogue box or drag and drop
the .json file on the "Product Explorer" window. There is no difference if the product is
delivered in GeoTiff, Jpeg2000 or NetCDF format.

.. .. todo::
   We should also explain how one can install the reader plugin necessary for the GeoTIFF and JP2 formats.

Open product:

- Select "File" -> "Open Products..." -> select ".json" file (see figure :ref:`4.4 <snapFileOpenOneExample>` and :ref:`4.5 <snapFileOpenTwoExample>`) or

- Drag & drop .json file on the "Product Explorer" part in SNAP (see figure 4.6).

   :align: center

   SNAP example: Open via drag & drop

Afterwards the product will be shown in the "Product Explorer" window. Now you can investigate the content of the
product by clicking on the "+" signs. To view the product, right-click on the product name in the "Product Explorer" and
select :ref:`"Open RGB Image Window" <snapRGBrightClick>`. In the :ref:`"Select RGB-Image Channels" <snapRGBprofile>` window choose a band
combination that fits your needs. In this example, the combination of Bands 4, 3, and 2 were used for RGB.

QGIS
====
QGIS users need to apply more steps to visually inspect the product.

**GeoTiff/Jpeg2000**

You have two options of inspecting the data in QGIS. You can either load all single raster bands and inspect them as
grey scale images, or you can create a raster stack and inspect an RGB image. For the first option you can either:

- :ref:`Drag & drop <qgisFileOpenFour>` the single bands (.tiff/.jp2) directly on the "Layers" window or

- Use the :ref:`"Add Raster Layer" <qgisFileOpenOne>` button and :ref:`select the single files <qgisFileOpenTwo>` and :ref:`add them <qgisFileOpenThree>` to QGIS.

.. _qgisFileOpenFour:
.. figure:: images/QGIS_open4.png

   :align: center

   QGIS example: Open with "Add Raster Layer"

.. _qgisFileOpenTwo:

   :name: qgisOpenThree
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: QGIS open example
   :align: center

   QGIS example: Load files into QGIS


If you use these two options, you will end up with :ref:`single raster bands in QGIS <qgisFileOpenGrey>` which you can inspect as greyscale images.

.. _qgisFileOpenGrey:
.. figure:: images/QGIS_grey.png
   :name: qgisOpenGrey
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: QGIS open example
   :align: center

   QGIS example: single raster files as grey scale images

If you want to create a raster stack from which you can create an RGB view, you first have to stack the single files.
For this again two options exist. Either you merge the data into a single raster stack or you create a GDAL Virtual Raster called VRT.

For the first option, you need to select :ref:`"Raster" -> "Miscellaneous" -> "Merge..." <qgisRGBOne>`.
Click :ref:`Add files(s) <qgisRGBTwo>` and select the files you like to stack. Then click :ref:`OK <qgisRGBThree>`. Make sure you check the
:ref:`"Place each input file into a seperate band" <qgisRGBFive>` check-box. Click the [...] button and select
:ref:`Save to "File..." <qgisRGBFour>`. Depending on your preferences you can
choose between different output formats like GeoTiff. If you choose GeoTiff, you might wish to build image
pyramids for faster display later on.

   :align: center

   QGIS example: Choose output format

If you decide to create a virtual raster stack (VRT), you need to select :ref:`"Raster" -> "Miscellaneous" -> "Build Virtual Raster..." <qgisRGBSix>`.
The steps are the same as for "Merge..". Again make sure to check "separate".
The generated product is very small, as it is only a reference to the real data, but it will be slow for the display of bigger images.

.. _qgisRGBSix:

   :name: qgisRGBSixExample
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: QGIS open example
   :align: center

   QGIS example: Select "Build Virtual Raster..." tool

Once one of the two processes is finished, the resulting layer stack will be loaded into QGIS.
Now you can open the :ref:`layer's property window and select the bands you like to view as an RGB <qgisRGBSeven>`.
For this example we have chosen R/G/B = 4/3/2. Afterwards your selection will be :ref:`displayed in QGIS <qgisRGBEight>`.

   QGIS example: RGB image bands 4/3/2 in QGIS

**NetCDF**

For the NetCDF format, there are small differences. Again, you can either use drag & drop or "Add Raster Layer" as described above.
After you have selected or dropped your NetCDF file, a :ref:`new window opens where you can select the raster layer <qgisRGBNine>` of the
NetCDF you like to add. Afterwards you have to :ref:`indicate the CRS <qgisRGBTen>` you are using. All selected raster
bands will be :ref:`added to QGIS <qgisRGBEleven>`. Now you can proceed the same way as described above. Either you merge
the data or build a VRT. Either way, the added files will show up in the :ref:`file selection window <qgisRGBTwelve>`.
Therefore, no files have to be added, just simply selected. All remaining
steps are the same as for GeoTiff/Jpeg2000

Time Series
***********

Besides raster products, the Mosaic Hub provides the functionality of extracting time series of a single pixel or 3x3 pixel window.
The result of those extractions can be exported and downloaded. For a full description of this functionality, please see :ref:`TimeSeries<time_series>`

File Format
===========
The time series extracts are provided in CSV format.
