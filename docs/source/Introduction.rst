Introduction
############

The objective of the S2GM service is the provision of mosaic image products derived from Sentinel-2 A and B platforms. The data products shall serve as input to further thematic processing, generation of higher level products, and analysis. The overarching requirement is the selection of the most representative spectrum for a given pixel, selected from the set of observations made during the temporal compositing period.
Input to the mosaicking process are surface reflectance values, the so-called Level 2A product. Level 2As are operationally produced by the Copernicus (ESA) ground segment. Currently ESA is using the sen2cor atmospheric correction processor for the generation of Level 2A products.
The products are available as daily, 10-day, monthly, seasonal, and annual composites. They are available in three different resolutions (10m, 20m, 60m) in NetCDF and GeoTiff / Jpeg2000 format.
