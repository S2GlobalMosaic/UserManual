Introduction
############

The objective of the S2GM service is the provision of mosaic image products derived from Sentinel-2 A and B platforms. The data products shall serve as input to further thematic processing, generation of higher level products, and analysis. The overarching requirement is the selection of the most representative spectrum for a given pixel, selected from the set of observations made during the temporal compositing period.
Input to the mosaicking process are surface reflectance values, the so-called Level 2A product. Level 2As are operationally produced by the Copernicus (ESA) ground segment. Currently ESA is using the sen2cor atmospheric correction processor for the generation of Level 2A products.
The first version of Deliverable 2 under this specific contract (SC2-D2) comprises Sentinel-2 (S2) L2A composite-mosaics of 20 test sites over Europe between 01/04/2017 and 30/03/2018. The products are available as daily, 10-day, monthly, seasonal, and annual composites. While nine test sites cover only single S2 granules, and thus only show the compositing performance, two test sites will show the quality of adjacent granules for later mosaicking, while additional 9 adjacent granules are used over one test site to show the mosaicking quality. The products are available in three different resolutions in NetCDF and GeoTiff / Jpeg2000 format.
